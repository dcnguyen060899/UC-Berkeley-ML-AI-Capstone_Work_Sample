            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Duy Nguyen, an AI engineer with a deep passion for machine learning and artificial intelligence. My journey in AI began with a strong foundation in data analysis and has evolved into a career dedicated to leveraging advanced models and techniques to solve complex problems.</p>

            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>I hold a Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence from UC Berkeley, where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, model evaluation, and AI development. My academic journey began with a Bachelor of Arts in Economics and Data Analysis from Simon Fraser University, equipping me with a strong analytical background.</p>

            <h3>Expertise</h3>
            <p>My expertise spans across developing and deploying machine learning models, with a strong command of Python and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I excel in feature engineering, model evaluation, and economic data analysis, enabling me to provide strategic business insights and data-driven solutions.</p>

            <h3>Notable Projects</h3>
            <p>One of my key projects involved optimizing marketing campaigns for customer subscriptions, where I conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis and identified critical features that significantly impacted subscription rates. This project highlighted the power of data-driven strategies in achieving business success.</p>

            <h3>Publications</h3>
            <p>My research work includes the paper "Wave Mechanics: The Key to Generalization in Overparameterized Neural Networks," which explores wave properties in neural networks and introduces a new framework for understanding generalization. I am also the author of "Exponential Neuron Networks: A PDE-Inspired Approach to Neural Architecture Design," where I introduce a novel neural network architecture inspired by partial differential equation solving techniques.</p>

            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>I am committed to pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning, with a focus on exploring new architectures and techniques that enhance the robustness and efficiency of neural networks. My goal is to contribute to the development of more advanced and reliable AI systems that can drive innovation across industries.</p>
