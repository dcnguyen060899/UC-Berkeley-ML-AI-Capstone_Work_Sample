            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Our project aimed to improve hospital resource management by predicting patient length of stay. Using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we've identified key factors affecting stay duration and developed models to optimize patient care and resource allocation.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <h3>1. Patient Demographics and Hospital Characteristics</h3>
            <img src="images/distribution_age_by_cluster.png" alt="Age Distribution">
            <ul>
                <li>Middle-aged patients (31-60 years) form the largest group requiring hospital care.</li>
                <li>Significant variations in patient volumes across hospital types and regions.</li>
                <li>Hospital codes 8 and 28 handle notably higher volumes, suggesting differences in capacity or specialization.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Length of Stay Patterns</h3>
            <img src="images/los_dist.png" alt="Length of Stay Distribution">
            <ul>
                <li>Most common stay durations cluster around 10, 20, and 30 days.</li>
                <li>Longer stays associated with:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trauma admissions</li>
                        <li>Severe illnesses</li>
                        <li>Departments like surgery and TB & Chest disease</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Readmission Insights</h3>
            <img src="images/Total_Readmissions_by_Department.png" alt="Readmissions by Department">
            <ul>
                <li>Higher readmission rates observed in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trauma cases</li>
                        <li>Moderate to extreme illness severity</li>
                        <li>Gynecology department</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Patients with more than 10 readmissions tend to have significantly longer average stays.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Key Predictive Factors</h3>

            <img src="images/neural_network_feature_importances_f5.png" alt="Neural Network Feature Importances Fold 5">
            <ul>
                <li>Hospital-specific factors (various hospital codes)</li>
                <li>Number of available extra rooms in the hospital</li>
                <li>Admission deposit amount</li>
                <li>Number of visitors with the patient</li>
                <li>Specific ward types</li>
                <li>Type of admission (particularly emergency and trauma)</li>
                <li>Severity of illness</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The consistency of these factors across different folds and modeling approaches underscores their robustness as predictors of hospital length of stay.</p>

            <h2>Recommendations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Resource Allocation: Optimize based on ward types and illness severity. Focus on high-demand wards (R, Q) and evaluate underutilized wards (P, T, U).</li>
                <li>Visitor Management: Develop structured visitor programs balancing patient support with operational efficiency.</li>
                <li>Financial Planning: Adjust admission deposit strategies to manage patient turnover more effectively.</li>
                <li>Tailored Care Plans: Personalize care based on admission type and illness severity, with special focus on medium-stay patients (10-40 days).</li>
                <li>Facility Improvements: Invest in upgrading bed grades and ensuring adequate extra rooms to improve care quality and management efficiency.</li>
                <li>Hospital-Specific Strategies: Implement best practices from high-performing hospitals, particularly in regions X and Y.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Follow-Up Care: Implement targeted post-discharge support for high-risk patients to reduce readmission rates.</li>
