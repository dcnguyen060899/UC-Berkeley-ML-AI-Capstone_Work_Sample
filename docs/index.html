            <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
            <p>Our project aimed to improve hospital resource management by predicting patient length of stay. Using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we've identified key factors affecting stay duration and developed models to optimize patient care and resource allocation.</p>

            <h2>Key Findings</h2>
            <h3>1. Patient Demographics and Hospital Characteristics</h3>
            <img src="images/distribution_age_by_cluster.png" alt="Distribution of Age by Cluster">
            <p>Middle-aged patients (31-60 years) form the largest group requiring hospital care. Significant variations in patient volumes across hospital types and regions. Hospital codes 8 and 28 handle notably higher volumes, suggesting differences in capacity or specialization.</p>

            <h3>2. Length of Stay Patterns</h3>
            <img src="images/los_dist.png" alt="Distribution of Length of Stay">
            <p>Most common stay durations cluster around 10, 20, and 30 days. Longer stays associated with trauma admissions, severe illnesses, and departments like surgery and TB & Chest disease.</p>

            <h3>3. Readmission Insights</h3>
            <img src="images/Total_Readmissions_by_Department.png" alt="Total Readmissions by Department">
            <p>Higher readmission rates observed in trauma cases, moderate to extreme illness severity, and the gynecology department. Patients with more than 10 readmissions tend to have significantly longer average stays.</p>

            <h3>4. Key Predictive Factors</h3>

            <img src="images/neural_network_feature_importances_f5.png" alt="Neural Network Feature Importances Fold 5">
            <p>Across all folds and models, including traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches, the following factors consistently emerged as the most influential in predicting length of stay: hospital-specific factors (various hospital codes), number of available extra rooms in the hospital, admission deposit amount, number of visitors with the patient, specific ward types, type of admission (particularly emergency and trauma), and severity of illness. The consistency of these factors across different folds and modeling approaches underscores their robustness as predictors of hospital length of stay. However, the varying order of importance across folds suggests that the impact of these features may differ slightly depending on the specific subset of data, highlighting the complex nature of predicting hospital stay durations.</p>
