                <h3><a href="https://mosaicmate.vercel.app/">AI Immigration Chatbot - MOSAIC</a></h3>
                <p>
                    Developed an AI-powered chatbot with SFU Blueprint for MOSAIC to assist Canadian Immigration Consultants, significantly enhancing user experience by providing personalized recommendations and real-time information in multiple languages. Leveraging technologies such as Flask for backend services, Neo4j for graph database integration, and OpenAI models for natural language processing, the chatbot efficiently processes user queries and retrieves relevant information. The project was shortlisted in the Top 4 of the SFU CS Diversity Award, recognizing its innovative approach to improving accessibility and efficiency for newcomers, immigrants, and refugees.
