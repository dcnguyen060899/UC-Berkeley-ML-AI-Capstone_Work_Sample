## Executive Summary
#### Project Goals and Objectives

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed significant challenges in hospital resource management, prompting our project to focus on identifying key factors affecting the duration of hospital stays. Our primary aim was to improve patient care, optimize resource allocation, and develop targeted strategies to reduce unnecessary extended hospitalizations. To achieve these objectives, we employed sophisticated machine learning and deep learning techniques, enabling us to:

1. **Enhance Patient Care:** Understand the social, financial, and demographic factors that impact patient recovery times, enabling the development of personalized care plans.
2. **Optimize Hospital Resources:** Identify operational bottlenecks and resource allocation inefficiencies to streamline patient management and reduce overall hospital stay durations.
3. **Develop Targeted Interventions:** Utilize data-driven insights to create and implement strategies that address specific factors contributing to prolonged hospital stays.

- **Interpretation**: This suggests that hospital type 'a' might be handling more complex cases or has a larger capacity.

#### Total Readmissions by City Code Hospital
![Total Readmissions by City Code Hospital](images/Total_Readmissions_by_City_Code_Hospital.png)
- **Observation**: Cities with hospital codes '1' and '2' have the highest readmissions.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates these hospitals are likely in urban areas with higher patient inflow.

#### Total Readmissions by Hospital Region
![Total Readmissions by Hospital Region Code](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Hospital_Region_Code.png)
- **Observation**: Regions 'X' and 'Y' have higher readmissions compared to region 'Z'.
- **Interpretation**: Suggests regional differences in hospital capacities or patient demographics.

#### Total Readmissions by Department
![Total Readmissions by Department](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Department.png)
- **Observation**: Gynecology department has the highest readmissions.
- **Interpretation**: This could indicate a higher volume of cases or a need for specialized follow-up care in this department.

#### Total Readmissions by Ward Type
![Total Readmissions by Ward Type](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Ward_Type.png)
- **Observation**: Ward type 'R' has the highest number of readmissions, followed by ward types 'Q' and 'S'. Ward types 'P', 'T', and 'U' have significantly lower readmissions.
- **Interpretation**: This suggests that ward type 'R' handles a higher volume of patients or more complex cases that lead to higher readmissions. The lower readmissions in ward types 'P', 'T', and 'U' may indicate either lower patient volumes or more effective patient management.

#### Total Readmissions by Ward Facility Code
![Total Readmissions by Ward Facility Code](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Ward_Facility_Code.png)
- **Observation**: Ward facility code 'F' has the highest number of readmissions, followed by codes 'E' and 'D'. Codes 'A', 'B', and 'C' have lower readmissions.
- **Interpretation**: This indicates that ward facility 'F' might be serving a larger or more critically ill patient population, resulting in higher readmissions. Facilities 'A', 'B', and 'C' might have better discharge planning or serve less critical cases.

#### Total Readmissions by Type of Admission
![Total Readmissions by Type of Admission](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Type_of_Admission.png)
- **Observation**: Trauma admissions have the highest number of readmissions, followed by emergency admissions. Urgent admissions have the lowest readmissions.
- **Interpretation**: The higher readmissions for trauma cases reflect the critical and often complex nature of these patients, requiring more frequent readmissions. Emergency cases also show high readmissions due to their acute nature, while urgent cases have comparatively lower readmissions.

#### Total Readmissions by Severity of Illness
![Total Readmissions by Severity of Illness](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Severity_of_Illness.png)
- **Observation**: Patients with moderate severity of illness have the highest number of readmissions, followed by those with extreme and minor severity.
- **Interpretation**: This suggests that patients with moderate severity of illness are more likely to be readmitted, possibly due to ongoing health issues that require repeated hospital care. Patients with extreme severity might have higher mortality rates or more intensive care leading to fewer readmissions, while those with minor severity are less likely to be readmitted.

#### Total Readmissions by Age
![Total Readmissions by Age](images/Total_Readmissions_by_Age.png)
- **Observation:** Patients in the age groups 31-40 and 41-50 have the highest number of readmissions, followed by those in the 21-30 and 51-60 age groups. The lowest number of readmissions is seen in the youngest (0-10) and oldest (91-100) age groups.
- **Interpretation:** This suggests that middle-aged adults (31-50) are more likely to be readmitted, possibly due to a higher prevalence of chronic conditions or lifestyle-related health issues that necessitate repeated hospital care. Younger children and older adults have lower readmission rates, which could be due to differing health care needs and mortality rates.

### Length of Stay

#### Distribution of Length of Stay
![Distribution of Length of Stay](images/los_dist.png)
- **Observation**: The distribution of length of stay shows multiple peaks, with the highest frequencies around 10, 20, and 30 days. There are also smaller peaks at intervals beyond 30 days.
- **Interpretation**: This multimodal distribution suggests that hospital stays often follow standardized durations, likely due to clinical protocols or typical recovery periods for certain treatments. The presence of peaks at regular intervals indicates that many patients are discharged after a predefined period, possibly aligned with the hospital's care plans and discharge policies. The smaller peaks at longer durations may reflect the needs of patients with more complex or severe conditions requiring extended care.

#### Length of Stay by Hospital Type
![Hospital Type Code vs Length of Stay](images/Hospital_Type_Code_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Variability in the length of stay is observed across different hospital types.
- **Interpretation**: Hospital type 'a' has more variability, suggesting it handles a broader range of patient conditions.

#### Length of Stay by Department
![Department vs Length of Stay](images/Department_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Departments such as surgery and TB & Chest disease show longer lengths of stay.
- **Interpretation**: This is expected as these departments typically handle more severe or complex cases.

#### Length of Stay by Ward Type
![Ward Type vs Length of Stay](images/Ward_Type_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Ward types 'T' and 'U' have longer lengths of stay.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates these wards may cater to more critical or long-term care patients.

#### Length of Stay by City Code Hospital

- **Observation**: Similar length of stay patterns across regions 'X', 'Y', and 'Z'.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates a standardized approach to patient care and management across regions.

#### Length of Stay by Type of Admission
![Type of Admission vs Length of Stay](images/Type_of_Admission_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: Trauma admissions tend to have longer stays compared to emergency and urgent admissions.
- **Interpretation**: Reflects the critical nature of trauma cases requiring extended care.

#### Length of Stay by Severity of Illness
![Severity of Illness vs Length of Stay](images/Severity_of_Illness_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)
- **Observation**: As expected, patients with extreme severity of illness have longer stays.
- **Interpretation**: Emphasizes the need for intensive care and prolonged treatment for more severe cases.

### Other Observations

#### Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix of Selected Numerical Features](images/Correlation_Matrix.png)
- **Observation**: Number of visitors with patients shows a positive correlation with the length of stay.
- **Interpretation**: Suggests that patients with more visitors might be staying longer due to more severe conditions or extended recovery times.

#### Distribution of Admission Deposits
![Distribution of Admission Deposit](images/Distribution_of_Admission_Deposit.png)
- **Observation**: Admission deposits show a normal distribution with most values clustering around the mean.
- **Interpretation**: Indicates a standardized billing approach across different admissions.

#### Distribution of Visitors with Patients
![Distribution of Visitors with Patient](images/Distribution_of_Visitors_with_Patient.png)
- **Observation**: Majority of patients have 0-5 visitors, with a sharp drop-off beyond that.
- **Interpretation**: Reflects social support patterns for hospitalized patients.

## Recommendations

- **Focus on High Readmission Departments**: Departments like gynecology with high readmissions should be assessed for possible improvements in patient follow-up care and discharge planning.
- **Regional and Hospital Type Differences**: Address discrepancies in readmission and length of stay across different regions and hospital types to ensure uniformity in patient care.
- **Enhance Trauma Care Facilities**: Given the longer stays for trauma admissions, hospitals should ensure adequate resources and specialized care for these patients.
- **Patient Support Programs**: Implement programs to support patients with longer lengths of stay, including social support and post-discharge follow-ups.

From the distribution from readmission and length of stay across features, I have notice that readmission and length of stay distribution has similar pattern. However, note that not all features that has the same distribution pattern bettewn readmission and length of stay. For example, ward facility code has the highest readmission in code F. But all ward facility codes exhibit a similar pattern in length of stay, with a high concentration of shorter stays (1-3 days).

- Patients with 0 readmissions have a mean stay of approximately 33 days.
- The mean length of stay for patients with 1-10 readmissions remains relatively stable around 31-32 days.
- For patients with more than 10 readmissions, the mean length of stay increases significantly, suggesting that a subset of patients with frequent readmissions require extended hospital stays due to complications or chronic conditions.


#### 1. Type of Admission

- **Emergency**: Patients admitted through emergency services tend to have varied lengths of stay, with a noticeable portion having longer stays. This category also sees frequent readmissions, indicating that patients admitted in emergencies may require longer recovery times and are more likely to be readmitted.
- **Trauma**: Trauma cases show a higher readmission count, and these patients also tend to have longer stays. This suggests that trauma patients often require extensive care and follow-up treatments, leading to longer hospital stays and higher readmission rates. Refer to the [Total Readmissions by Type of Admission](#total-readmissions-by-type-of-admission) and [Type of Admission vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-type-of-admission) images.
- **Urgent**: Urgent admissions also display a pattern of higher readmission counts and longer lengths of stay, though not as pronounced as trauma cases. This indicates that urgent cases, while serious, might not require as prolonged care as trauma cases but still exhibit a significant need for readmission and extended stays.

#### 2. Severity of Illness

- **Extreme**: Patients with extreme severity of illness have the longest lengths of stay and highest readmission counts. This is expected, as more severe cases generally require longer hospitalization and are at a higher risk of complications leading to readmission. Refer to the [Severity of Illness vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-severity-of-illness) and [Total Readmissions by Severity of Illness](#total-readmissions-by-severity-of-illness) images.
- **Moderate**: Patients with moderate severity show a balanced pattern but still exhibit significant lengths of stay and readmission counts, indicating that even moderate cases can be complex and require careful management.
- **Minor**: Minor severity cases have the shortest stays and lowest readmission counts, suggesting that these patients recover quicker and have a lower likelihood of complications that necessitate readmission.

#### 3. Hospital Departments

- **Radiotherapy**: Patients in the radiotherapy department have varied lengths of stay, with a significant number having longer stays. This department also sees higher readmission rates, likely due to the ongoing nature of cancer treatments.
- **Anesthesia**: The anesthesia department has moderate lengths of stay and readmission counts, reflecting the typical recovery times associated with surgical procedures.
- **Gynecology**: Gynecology patients generally have shorter stays and lower readmission counts, suggesting efficient treatment and recovery processes. Refer to the [Total Readmissions by Department](#total-readmissions-by-department) image.
- **TB & Chest disease**: This department shows higher lengths of stay and readmission counts, indicating the complexity and chronic nature of respiratory illnesses. Refer to the [Department vs Length of Stay](#length-of-stay-by-department) image.
- **Surgery**: Surgical patients exhibit a broad range of stay lengths and readmission rates, depending on the type and severity of the surgery performed.


### Confirming the Pattern: Readmission and Length of Stay

1. **Readmission Count vs. Length of Stay**
   ![Readmission Count vs Length of Stay](images/Readmission_Count_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)

   - The box plot indicates a general trend where higher readmission counts are associated with longer lengths of stay. Patients with more frequent readmissions tend to have a higher median length of stay, especially noticeable beyond 10 readmissions.

2. **Cumulative Stay vs. Length of Stay**
   ![Cumulative Stay vs Length of Stay](images/Cumulative_Stay_vs_Length_of_Stay.png)

   - The scatter plot shows the distribution of cumulative stays in relation to individual lengths of stay. While there are some outliers, the data points suggest that patients with longer individual stays tend to accumulate more days in the hospital overall, reinforcing the pattern observed in the readmission count. Overall, The visualization reinforces the pattern observed in the statistical summary. Higher readmission counts are generally associated with longer lengths of stay.

### Implications

These insights imply that:

- **Higher Readmission and Length of Stay**: Certain categories, such as trauma admissions and patients with extreme severity of illness, consistently show higher readmission counts and longer lengths of stay. This suggests that these patient groups are particularly vulnerable and may benefit from more intensive post-discharge care and monitoring to reduce readmissions and hospital stay durations.
- **Focused Interventions**: Hospitals can implement targeted interventions for high-risk groups, such as trauma and severe illness patients, to manage their care more effectively. This could include enhanced discharge planning, follow-up care, and outpatient support to reduce the likelihood of readmission and shorten hospital stays.
- **Resource Allocation**: Understanding these patterns can help hospitals allocate resources more efficiently. Departments with higher readmission rates and longer stays may require additional staff, specialized equipment, or dedicated programs to manage patient care more effectively.
